               Developed a passion for coding after teaching myself to code in vba in order to automate some of the tasks i did.
               Shortly after learning vba i applied and completed a 
               coding bootcamp through UNC chapel hill that covered MERN stack development. While taking this course I also completed
               both mobile responsiveness and javascript and algorithms certifications through freeCodeCamp

                       <p>

                               My previous work experience has giving me a considerable amount of experience with working with teams both near and far as I had to coordinate
                               shipments from not only the warehouse I worked at but also coordinated shipments from an offsite warehouse. Keeping track of the stock in both
                               locations and transferring stock as needed, answering all calls, and completing all the paperwork needed for any international or dangerous goods shipment.
