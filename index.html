                I got into coding because of the job I had in shipping. I started to code using vba for my job in shipping in order to add automation, because I liked coding and the benefits that it granted me I decided that I wanted to learn more about coding and transition into that industry. 
                Completed coding bootcamp through UNC chapel hill that covered MERN stack development. While taking this course also completed both mobile responsivensess and javascript and algorithms certifications thourgh freecodeCamp

                I also have a lot of expierence working with groups both near and far as for my job in shipping I coordinated all shipments and international documents for any shipments leaving both mine and our offsite warehouse in California.
